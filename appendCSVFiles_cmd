Using the command prompt window (cmd), you may append the csv files after
changing the directory to where they are saved, as follows:

cd\
cd "C:\Users\Owner\Documents\DataAnalysisExcel\International Sales"   (in my case for example)
copy *.csv InternationalSales.csv

Then check the files in the directory using the "dir" command in the cmd window
